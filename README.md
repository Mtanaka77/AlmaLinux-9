## AlmaLinux on Water-Ice MD and ab-initio Siesta-4

We have tested the linux operating system that is AlmaLinux. 
It runs well in normal operations except for some errors as shown below.

For the successor of terminated CentOS 7, we have downloaded the
AlmaLinux on the laptop PC. The OS installation has been done in
AlmaLinux-9.4-x86_64-dvd.iso of 10 GB memory [1]. That is finished
in 15 minutes which is then rebooted for new Linux windows.

At the beginning, we open the gfotran by typing # gfortran -V, which
is necessary on AlmaLinux-9. We also type # pip3 -V to open PIP.
The MPI of mpich4 is downloaded and installed for the water and ice MD [2]
and the quantum mechanics Siesta-4.1 code [3].

At the first test, the three-dimensional ice and water molecules 
@p3mtip5p03a.f03 is compiled with a parameter file parm_tip5p_D07a.h, 
and structure files 1cx666a.exyz and 1cx666a.q [2]. 
The mpich-4 and fftw-3 packages must be installed before the compilation. 
The exec run for 6 cpu with a start file TIP507_config.start0 is executed 
by # mpiexec -n 6 a.out &, which runs all right.

The initial settings of the water molecules is constructed in quaternions [4]. 
The pips package is installed and is fine at usual linux systems including CentOS 7. 
Also the Windows 11 system is ok using the C/C++ packages of Vidual Studio Community, 
and then the pip3 package. However, the AlmaLinux-9 fails due to one of the packages 
parilist before we install # pip3 install genice. ã€€


Next at the second test, we download the Siesta-4.1b code [3] and unpack by:  
% tar -zxvf siesta-4.1b.tar.gz. Before working on the Siesta code, 
it is necessary to install the OpenBLAS and Scalapack packages.
For OpenBLAS, it is straight forward after a while.
However, for Scalapack, the installation went wrong although 
we typed # make -i, since VirtualBox settings of AlmaLinux-9 showed 
unnecessary errors without success. So for the rescue, the import of 
./lib/libscalapack.a is borrowed from the fading CentOS 7.

The arch.make file for the MPI case mpifort is the following (the upper half
of the arch.make):  
  .SUFFIXES:  
  .SUFFIXES: .f .F .o .c .a .f90 .F90  
  SIESTA_ARCH = gfortran-MPI  

  CC = mpicc  
  FPP = $(FC) -E -P -x c  
  FC = mpifort  

  MPI_INTERFACE = libmpi_f90.a  
  MPI_INCLUDE = .   

  FFLAGS = -O2 -fPIC -ftree-vectorize -march=native -fallow-argument-mismatch  
 #FFLAGS = -O2 -fexpensive-optimizations -ftree-vectorize -fprefetch-loop-arrays -march=native -fPIC -fopenmp  
  FC_SERIAL = gfortran  

  AR = ar  
  RANLIB = ranlib  
  SYS = nag  

  SP_KIND = 4  
  DP_KIND = 8  
  KINDS   = $(SP_KIND) $(DP_KIND)   
  
  FPPFLAGS = -DMPI   
  LDFLAGS  =  
  INCFLAGS =  
  INSDIR = /opt  
  COMP_LIBS =     # libsiestaLAPACK.a libsiestaBLAS.a  
  LDFLAGS += -L$(INSDIR)/openblas/lib -Wl,-rpath=$(INSDIR)/openblas/lib  
  LIBS = -lgomp -L/opt/openblas/lib -lopenblas  
  LIBS += -L/opt/scalapack/lib -lscalapack  

The Siesta-4.1b is installed by "make -i" because the error stop is avoided.
The test is shown in the Siesta-4.1bTest.pdf [5].
